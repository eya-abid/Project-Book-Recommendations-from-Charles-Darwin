# Project-Book-Recommendations-from-Charles-Darwin

Recommendation systems are at the heart of many products such as Netflix or Amazon. They generally rely on metadata (e.g., the actors or director of a movie) or on user tastes (e.g., the movies you liked before) to determine which we are most likely to enjoy. But when we are working with text-heavy datasets, we have access to a much richer resourceâ€”the whole text! 

In this project, we will learn how to build the basis of a book recommendation system based on their content. We will use Charles Darwin's bibliography to find out which books might be interesting.

The dataset was manually collected from Project Gutenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org/
